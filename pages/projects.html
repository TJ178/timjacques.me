            <h1>Bus Tracker</h1>
            <p>November 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            At my new apartment, there's a bus stop about a 3 minute walk away that speeds up my commute to class by about 8 minutes.
            I realized that I was checking Google Maps everyday for the transit times, and figured I could find a way to get realtime bus data on a screen in my apartment instead.
            <br><br>
            LA Metro offers a transit API with realtime data using Google's GTFS format. Unfortunately, this meant that I couldn't just use an ESP32, since the API would only send
            the status of the entire bus system, rather than just one specific stop, which was about 3x as much data as the ESP32 has RAM.
            <br><br>
            The solution? Create a server that runs on a larger device to act as a middle-man.
            <br> With that in mind, I have a server at home that grabs the bus data, parses it down to just the times of the next buses, and offers that up as an HTTP server.
            Now, the ESP32 can just do a simple HTTP GET request, and we're in business.
            <br><br>
            Engineering is about spending 3 hours to save 30 seconds everyday right?

            This website is one of my current projects! It's been fun to work with pure HTML and CSS.
            I haven't done too much webdev, so this took me a bit to put together. Although, now I guess I could be a "fullstack"
            engineer - from processor architecture all the way to frontend software!

            <h1>Discovering the Kroger API</h1>
            <p>Summer 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            During Summer 2023, I lived with a group of mechanical engineers that always cooked together.
            Each of the six of us would cook once a week, and we'd only have to cook once a week and get ready-made meals the rest of the week. 
            <br>Good deal, right?<br>
            <br>To feed six hungry college students though, we'd go through about $300 of groceries a week, and spend 2 hours at the grocery store each time.
            That's far too long, so instead we opted to write a program that would categorize and order groceries for us to pick up.
            <br><br>Kroger, our local grocery store chain, has a public API that allows adding items to a virtual cart, so we wrote a program that
            takes in data from a spreadsheet, consolidates all of the different recipes, then adds it to the cart!
            <br><br> Now, getting food for the week is just as fast (or slow) as figuring out what to cook.

            <h1>Starship Micromouse</h1>
            <p>Spring 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            After leading Micromouse, I still wanted to create my very-own mouse, but had to make it a bit special.
            There are these food delivery robots (Starships) that roam around UCLA's campus, so I decided to make a tiny one as a fun micromouse.
            <br><br>
            The hardest part about this one was just the design itself- I had to model the entire Starship myself, and design the PCB such that everything fit together.
            Because of the model, the robot was already pretty large for the maze, so the PCB inside had to be as compact as possible.
            <br><br>
            As a mini Starship, it looks fantastic! I even put an LED into the flag so that it would blink like the real ones.
            <br>
            As a micromouse, however, it was not so great, since the front and back wheels made it challenging to turn accurately.
            The next version will make it such that the front and back wheels aren't used at all, to hopefully prevent this issue.

            This involved determining the best radio transceivers to use over an entire football field, researching and purchasing the electronics, and writing reliable code for showtime.
