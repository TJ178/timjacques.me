            <h1>Bus Tracker</h1>
            <p>November 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            At my new apartment, there's a bus stop about a 3 minute walk away that speeds up my commute to class by about 8 minutes.
            I realized that I was checking Google Maps everyday for the transit times, and figured I could find a way to get realtime bus data on a screen in my apartment instead.
            <br><br>
            LA Metro offers a transit API with realtime data using Google's GTFS format. Unfortunately, this meant that I couldn't just use an ESP32, since the API would only send
            the status of the entire bus system, rather than just one specific stop, which was about 3x as much data as the ESP32 has RAM.
            <br><br>
            The solution? Create a server that runs on a larger device to act as a middle-man.
            <br> With that in mind, I have a server at home that grabs the bus data, parses it down to just the times of the next buses, and offers that up as an HTTP server.
            Now, the ESP32 can just do a simple HTTP GET request, and we're in business.
            <br><br>
            Engineering is about spending 3 hours once to save 30 seconds everyday right?

            This website is one of my current projects! It's been fun to work with pure HTML and CSS.
            Webdev can be a bit of a rabbithole, so trying to stay away from fancy frameworks and JavaScript has made things a lot simpler.
            <br><br>
            As I find more time to work on this, hopefully this page and others will become more fleshed out.

            <h1>Discovering the Kroger API</h1>
            <p>Summer 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            During Summer 2023, I lived with a group of mechanical engineers that always cooked together.
            Each of the six of us would cook once a week, and we'd only have to cook once a week and get ready-made meals the rest of the week. 
            <br>Good deal, right?<br>
            <br>To feed six hungry college students though, we'd go through about $300 of groceries a week, and spend 2 hours at the grocery store each time.
            That's far too long, so instead we opted to write a program that would categorize and order groceries for us to pick up.
            <br><br>Kroger, our local grocery store chain, has a public API that allows adding items to a virtual cart, so we wrote a program that
            takes in data from a spreadsheet, consolidates all of the different recipes, then adds it to the cart!
            <br><br> Now, getting food for the week is just as fast (or slow) as figuring out what to cook.

            <h1>Starship Micromouse</h1>
            <p>Spring 2023</p>
         </div>
         <p>
            After leading Micromouse, I still wanted to create my very-own mouse, but had to make it a bit special.
            There are these food delivery robots (Starships) that roam around UCLA's campus, so I decided to make a tiny one as a fun micromouse.
            <br><br>
            The hardest part about this one was just the design itself- I had to model the entire Starship myself, and design the PCB such that everything fit together.
            Because of the model, the robot was already pretty large for the maze, so the PCB inside had to be as compact as possible.
            <br><br>
            As a mini Starship, it looks fantastic! I even put an LED into the flag so that it would blink like the real ones.
            <br>
            As a micromouse, however, it was not so great, since the front and back wheels made it challenging to turn accurately.
            The next version will make it such that the front and back wheels aren't used at all, to hopefully prevent this issue.

         <p>For my computer architecture honors section, I was tasked with implementing a limited-instruction-set RISC-V out of order processor in SystemVerilog.
            Specifically, I needed to implement a few R, S, and I-type instructions in a 2-issue, 7-stage pipelined processor that ran in simulation in ModelSim.

            Using ModelSim, I was able to write, simulate, and debug all of the various modules related to the architecture (Re-Order Buffer, Reservation Station, etc).

            designed the button's acuation around pen springs, since no larger springs were available, and the actual press detection around an IR break sensor.

            At the end of the year, students were given the choice between completing a capstone project of their choice or to complete a Digital Audio Visualizer, which involves
            implementing a Fast Fourier Transform in hardware and displaying the output of a microphone on screen.
            <br><br> When I completed DAV, I did the Digital Audio Visualizer project, and implemented an FFT on the FPGA.

            LoRax is a forest fire detection platform that I designed along with 4 other people during the hardware hackathon IDEAHacks in 2020. Essentially, LoRax was a mesh-networked node system that would use an array of sensors to detect weather patterns and potential wildfires.
            <br><br>
            My part in the design was to choose the parts and overall hardware design, so I spent my time in CAD creating a 3D-printable enclosure for a tree-mounted node. Additionally,
            I helped write portions of the software that interfaced with the array of sensors, creating hardware proof-of-concepts for the more computer science-inclined group members to refer to.
            <br><br>
